# `015` car route

A car can cover a distance of `N` kilometers per day. How many days will it take to cover a route of length `M` kilometers?

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a `car_route()` function that, given the distance it can drive in one day as the first parameter, and the distance to drive as the second parameter, calculates the number of days it will take to drive that distance.

## 📎 Example input:

```py
car_route(20, 40)
```

## 📎 Example output:

```py
2
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The program gets two numbers: `N` and `M`.

+ You must round up the outcome if you get a float, for example, if it takes you 1.1 days to travel the distance, it must return 2.

+ You may need to import the `math` module for this exercise.
