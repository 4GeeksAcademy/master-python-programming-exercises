# `08` Hours and Minutes

## 📝 Instructions:

Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - 

1. How many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?

The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 1339).

For example:

* If N = 3900 --> then 3900 seconds have passed since midnight - i.e. now it's 1:05am. 

So the program should print 1 65 --> 1 full hour is passed since midnight, 65 full minutes passed since midnight.

### Example input:

+ 3900

### Example output:

+ (1, 65)
