# `022` Integral

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `squares_dictionary()`. The function receives a number `n` and should generate a dictionary that contains pairs of the form `(n: n*n)` for each number in the range from 1 to n, inclusive.

2. Print the resulting dictionary.

## 📎 Example input:

```py
squares_dictionary(8)
```

## 📎 Example output:

```py
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ A `for` loop would be a good idea.
