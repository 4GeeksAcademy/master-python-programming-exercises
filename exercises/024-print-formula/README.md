# `024` print formula

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function `print_formula()` that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula: `Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]`. The fixed value of `C` is 50 and and the fixed value of `H` is 30. `D` is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.

## Example input:

```py
print_formula(100,150,180)
```

## Example output:

+ 18,22,24

## 💡 Hints:

+ If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is `26.0`, it should be printed as `26`).

+ In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
