# `025` Print formula

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function `print_formula()`, with one parameter that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:

```text
Q = Square root of (2 * c * d) / h
```

*Following are the fixed values of `c` and `h`:*

+ `c` is 50.
+ `h` is 30.
+ `d` would be the parameter of the function.

## 📎 Example input:

```py
print_formula(150)
```

## 📎 Example output:

```py
22
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26).

+ Import the `math` module.
