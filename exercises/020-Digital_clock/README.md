# `20` Digital Clock

## 📝 Instructions:

Given the integer N - the number of minutes that is passed since midnight - how many hours and minutes are displayed on the 24h digital clock?

The program should print two numbers: the number of hours (between 0 and 23) and the number of minutes (between 0 and 59).

For example, if N = 150, then 150 minutes have passed since midnight - i.e. now is 2:30 am. So the program should print 2 30.

**Example input**
150

**Example output**
(2, 30)
