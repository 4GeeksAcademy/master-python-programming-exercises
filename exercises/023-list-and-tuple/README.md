# `023` List and tuple

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `list_and_tuple()`, that given a input of `n` numbers returns a list and a tuple of those numbers and transforms each of them into a string.

2. Print the list, and in the next line, print the tuple.

## 📎 Example input:

```py
list_and_tuple(34,67,55,33,12,98)
```

## 📎 Example output:

```py
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ The number of parameters accepted by the function is not limited.

+ To make a function that accepts an unlimited number of arguments, use the `*` operator and then any name you want for it. For example:

```py
def my_function(*args)
```
