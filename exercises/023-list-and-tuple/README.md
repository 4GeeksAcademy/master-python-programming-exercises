# `23` List and touple

Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

Hints:
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
tuple() method can convert list to tuple
