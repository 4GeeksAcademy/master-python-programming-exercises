# `036` validity of password

## 📝 Instructions:

1. A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users. Following are the criteria to check the password:

- At least 1 letter between [a-z]. 
- At least 1 number between [0-9]. 
- At least 1 letter between [A-Z]. 
- At least 1 character from [$#@]. 
- Minimum length of transaction password: 6. 
- Maximum length of transaction password: 12. 


*Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.* 

## Example input:

```py
ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
```

## Example output:

```py
ABd1234@1
```
 
## 💡 Hint:

+ In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
