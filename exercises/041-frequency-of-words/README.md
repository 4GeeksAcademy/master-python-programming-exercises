# `041` Frequency of words

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function called `compute_word_frequency()` to compute the frequency of the words from a string input.

2. Put each word separated by a space in a dictionary and count its frequency.

3. Sort the dictionary alphanumerically and print in the console each key in a new line.

## 📎 Example input:

```py
compute_word_frequency("New to Python or choosing between Python 2 and Python 3? Read Python 2 or Python 3.")
```

## 📎 Example output:

```text
2: 2
3.: 1
3?: 1
New: 1
Python: 5
Read: 1
and: 1
between: 1
choosing: 1
or: 2
to: 1
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ You can put each word of a string in a list with the `split()` method, then it is easier to work on it.
